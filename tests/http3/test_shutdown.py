"""HTTP/3 graceful shutdown (RFC 9114 s5.2).

Behavioral HTTP/3 tests. They require the optional ``wreath._native._http3`` backend
(WREATH_BUILD_HTTP3=1 with ngtcp2/nghttp3) and are skipped otherwise; in the
dedicated HTTP/3 CI job the backend is present and these run. The executable
detail is completed with the endpoint implementation (Step 5); the endpoint is
exercised through the ``h3_module`` fixture and a real QUIC client, never a mock.
